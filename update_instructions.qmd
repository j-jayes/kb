## Purpose

Dear Kbae, I'm so stoked that you will be a website gal!

This page includes the instructions for how to update this website. There's a part explaining how it works first, and then what you need to do to make changes next.

## Explanation

The website is created from code stored in a github repository on my github, which you can see [here](https://github.com/j-jayes/kb): 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/github_home.PNG")
```

Any time the code in folder called `_site` changes, the website will automatically update. To update the contents of the `_site` folder, you simply make changes to the quarto documents (ending in .qmd) that control the website, call `quarto::quarto_render` inside Rstudio and then push the changes to github.

You'll have to create a github account and then I can add you as a collaborator on the repository so that you can push your changes directly. 

### Site Structure

We can break down the site into content, layout and style, e.g.

- content: a page describing the reports that you have contributed to,
- layout: what appears on the navigation bar, how you interact with the website, and
- style: colours, font choice and size of different text

You'll want to change content most frequently, so we will start with that.

#### Content

The site content is made up of different Quarto documents (files that end in `.qmd`) that are rendered into HTML. 

You make changes to these Quarto documents, call the command `quarto::quarto_render()` and then the HTML is created and the output is placed in the `_site` folder.

The main one is called `index.qmd`. It determines the content on the main page.

Making changes to quarto documents is super easy, it's just markdown - a language that is easy for humans to read.

A quarto file has a YAML section at the top, and then markdown below. An example is shown below.

```{echo=T, eval=F}

This report was very important and had a big impact! Here is how you can make a [link](https://github.com/j-jayes/kb)  to access it.

#### Layout

The layout of the website can be changed in the `_quarto.yml` file. For example if you want to add new items on the navigation bar at the top, or change the title, this is where you would do it.

#### Style

The style of the website, including the fonts and colours, are set with the files called  `style_blue.css` and `theme.scss`.

## Getting going

### Installing things!

To update this site, you need to have the website building tool called Quarto installed. You also need R and Rstudio installed, and the quarto package for R.

As an analogy, think of a car. Quarto is the engine, and Rstudio is the steering wheel. You don't control Quarto directly, you steer in Rstudio.

To install Quarto onto your computer, follow the [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide. 

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/")
```


<blockquote>
QuartoÂ® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc
</blockquote>

I assume that you have R and Rstudio installed, but if not, you can follow this guide from [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html).

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html")
```

### Git and Github

I don't think there is a need to explain Git and Github here. They are amazing and if you are interested then [this guide](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html) from Jenny Bryan is the best resource. She lays out exactly how the two differ [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/). All you need to know to update the website is that before making changes you have to use `git pull` in the terminal, make your changes, then commit these changes and push them to Github. Then the website automatically updates.
