During this year-long project, I assisted the Raith Foundation with a systematic internal review of their grant-making process, by analysing a random sample of the grants made in the past 10 years. This included detailed operationalisation of 'successful' grants, designing forms for grant assessments, and analysing the collected data in R, to produce a report on the findings.
