description: "During this year-long project, I assisted the Raith Foundation with a systematic internal review of their grant-making process, by analysing a random sample of the grants made in the past 10 years. This was a project in parallel with the lead consultant, David Barnard who conducted further qualitative analyses with Raith grantees."

My work for this project included detailed operationalisation of 'successful' grants, designing forms for grant assessments, collating the findings, and analysing the collected data in R, to produce a report on the findings.
