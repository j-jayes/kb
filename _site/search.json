The report also analyses how specialized units have been instrumental in bringing justice to victims of the Syrian conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull report\n\n\n\n\nGrid photo by Tingey Injury Law Firm on Unsplash"

    "text": "Hi!\nI’m a Masters graduate in International Development from Sciences Po, currently working as Project Manager at the LearningPlanet Alliance, an Alliance between UNESCO and the Learning Planet Institute.\nI’m passionate about data, storytelling and advocacy about socio-economic development, inequality, and making a positive impact on the world. I come from a long line of activists (all the way back to my great-grandmother) who protested against the injustice of apartheid over 60 cumulative years. Growing up hearing my family’s stories gave me a profound appreciation for social justice. I gravitate towards this field consciously, through my experience and political convictions, and unconsciously, through my heritage. Although apartheid ended the year before I was born, discriminatory vestiges of this regime permeate through its descendants and after-effects. Growing up in this politically tense period, I have listened, and finally contributed, to an evolving conversation about the need for tangible transformation through truly global development.\nUse the above tabs to browse my published reports and articles on these and related topics.

    "text": "Explanation\nThe website is created from code stored in a github repository on my github, which you can see here:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/github_home.PNG\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny time the code in folder called _site changes, the website will automatically update. To update the contents of the _site folder, you simply make changes to the quarto documents (ending in .qmd) that control the website, call quarto::quarto_render inside Rstudio and then push the changes to github.\nYou’ll have to create a github account and then I can add you as a collaborator on the repository so that you can push your changes directly.\n\nSite Structure\nWe can break down the site into content, layout and style, e.g.\n\ncontent: a page describing the reports that you have contributed to,\nlayout: what appears on the navigation bar, how you interact with the website, and\nstyle: colours, font choice and size of different text\n\nYou’ll want to change content most frequently, so we will start with that.\n\nContent\nThe site content is made up of different Quarto documents (files that end in .qmd) that are rendered into HTML.\nYou make changes to these Quarto documents, call the command quarto::quarto_render() and then the HTML is created and the output is placed in the _site folder.\nThe main one is called index.qmd. It determines the content on the main page.\nMaking changes to quarto documents is super easy, it’s just markdown - a language that is easy for humans to read.\nA quarto file has a YAML section at the top, and then markdown below. An example is shown below.\n---\ntitle: \"Example report\"\nauthor: Katherine Brown\ndate: 03-01-2022\nimage: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/kb/main/reports/julia-taubitz-0dFnhliQ82w-unsplash.jpg\"\ndescription: \"Description of post goes here!\"\n---\n\nThis report was very important and had a big impact! Here is how you can make a [link](https://github.com/j-jayes/kb)  to access it.\n\n\nLayout\nThe layout of the website can be changed in the _quarto.yml file. For example if you want to add new items on the navigation bar at the top, or change the title, this is where you would do it.\n\n\nStyle\nThe style of the website, including the fonts and colours, are set with the files called style_blue.css and theme.scss."

You also need R and Rstudio installed, and the quarto package for R.\nAs an analogy, think of a car. Quarto is the engine, and Rstudio is the steering wheel. You don’t control Quarto directly, you steer in Rstudio.\nTo install Quarto onto your computer, follow the Get Started guide.\n\nknitr::include_url(\"https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\")\n\n\n\n\nQuarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc\n\nI assume that you have R and Rstudio installed, but if not, you can follow this guide from Modern Dive.\n\nknitr::include_url(\"https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html\")\n\n\n\n\n\nGit and Github\nI don’t think there is a need to explain Git and Github here. They are amazing and if you are interested then this guide from Jenny Bryan is the best resource. She lays out exactly how the two differ here. All you need to know to update the website is that before making changes you have to use git pull in the terminal, make your changes, then commit these changes and push them to Github. Then the website automatically updates."
