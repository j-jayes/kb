# Hi there!

I'm a Masters graduate in International Development from Sciences Po, currently working as Project Manager at the #LearningPlanet Alliance, which was born out of the Learning Planet Institute.

In my current role, I manage the Ubuntu Learning Circle, a collection of like-minded organisations united in their pursuit of local solutions to local issues at a global scale. Organisations are affiliated with the #LearningPlanet Alliance or our partner in this project, the Club of Rome. 

I'm passionate about research and advocacy in the areas of socio-economic development, inequality,  and making a difference in the lives of vulnerable people. I come from a long line of activists (all the way back to my great-grandmother!) who protested against the injustice of apartheid over 60 cumulative years. Growing up hearing my family's stories gave me a profound appreciation for social justice. I gravitate towards this field consciously, through my experience and political convictions, and unconsciously, through my heritage. Although apartheid ended the year before I was born, discriminatory vestiges of this regime permeate through its descendants and after-effects. Growing up in this politically tense period, I have listened, and finally contributed, to an evolving conversation about the need for tangible transformation through truly global development.

<h2 style="color:#23A7CE">Education</h2>

I have enjoyed an enriching education from two top-rated institutions in their fields of expertise.

<h2 style="color:#23A7CE">Volunteering</h2>

I have also given back through my time at Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator.
