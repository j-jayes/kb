## Website elements

### Colours

The colours are borrowed from [Fragonard](https://www.fragonard.com/en-int/eau-du-bonheur/eau-du-bonheur-p-1916.htm):

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/col_pal_fragonard.jpg")
```

The colour palette looks like this: 

```{r}
scales::show_col(c("#23A7CE", "#97D0D7", "#2AB9B7"))
```

### Build

This site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) -- an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It is deployed on [Github Pages](https://github.com/j-jayes/kb).
